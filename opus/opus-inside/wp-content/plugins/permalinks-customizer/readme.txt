Set permalinks for default PostTypes, custom PostTypes, default Taxonomies (Category/Tags) and custom Taxonomies which can be changed from the edit page.

== Description ==

Customize your URL and set the slug. You can use basic keywords which is defined by the wordpress for defining the permalinks as well as some new keywords which is defined by this plugin. All the keywords are defined on the Tags page under Permalinks Customizer.

By using <strong>Permalinks Customizer</strong> you can set the different permalink structure for each post-type and taxonomy.

= How to set the Permalinks for the PostTypes seperately =

Let's assume that you have 6 <strong>PostTypes</strong> and they all have different style of <strong>permalinks</strong>. Like: 

1. <strong>Blog :</strong> For this post type you want to create a <strong>permalink</strong> which looks like this: http://www.example.com/blog/year-month-date-postname/
2. <strong>Customers :</strong> For this post type you want to create a <strong>permalink</strong> which looks like this: http://www.example.com/customers/postname/
3. <strong>Events :</strong> For this post type you want to create a <strong>permalink</strong> which looks like this: http://www.example.com/events/year-month-date-postname/
4. <strong>Press :</strong> For this post type you want to create a <strong>permalink</strong> which looks like this: http://www.example.com/press/category/year/postname/
5. <strong>News :</strong> For this post type you want to create a <strong>permalink</strong> which looks like this: http://www.example.com/news/year/postname/
6. <strong>Sponsors :</strong> For this post type you want to create a <strong>permalink</strong> which looks like this: http://www.example.com/company/sponsor/post_title/

This plugin allows you to do this very easily. You just need to go on <strong>Permalinks Customizer</strong> Settings Page. Where text fields are shown with post-type name. You can define your permalinks you want to create for each post type. 

If you leave the some post-type fields empty. So, <strong>Permalinks Customizer</strong> would create a permalink for that post-type by using the default <strong>permalink</strong> settings.

== Structure Tags ==

=== Tags for PostTypes ===

* <strong>%title%</strong> : Title of the post. let's say the title is "This Is A Great Post!" so, it becomes this-is-a-great-post in the URI.
* <strong>%year%</strong> : The year of the post, four digits, for example 2004
* <strong>%monthnum%</strong> : Month of the year, for example 05
* <strong>%day%</strong> : Day of the month, for example 28
* <strong>%hour%</strong> : Hour of the day, for example 15
* <strong>%minute%</strong> : Minute of the hour, for example 43
* <strong>%second%</strong> : Second of the minute, for example 33
* <strong>%post_id%</strong> : The unique ID # of the post, for example 423
* <strong>%postname%</strong> : A sanitized version of the title of the post (post slug field on Edit Post/Page panel). So "This Is A Great Post!" becomes this-is-a-great-post in the URI.
* <strong>%parent_postname%</strong> : A sanitized version of the title of the post (post slug field on Edit Post/Page panel). So "This Is A Great Post!" becomes this-is-a-great-post in the URI. This <strong>Tag</strong> contains Immediate <strong>Parent Page Slug</strong> if any parent page is selected before publishing.
* <strong>%all_parents_postname%</strong> : A sanitized version of the title of the post (post slug field on Edit Post/Page panel). So "This Is A Great Post!" becomes this-is-a-great-post in the URI. This <strong>Tag</strong> contains all the <strong>Parent Page Slugs</strong> if any parent page is selected before publishing.
* <strong>%category%</strong> : A sanitized version of the category name (category slug field on New/Edit Category panel). Nested sub-categories appear as nested directories in the URI.
* <strong>%child-category%</strong> : A sanitized version of the category name (category slug field on New/Edit Category panel).
* <strong>%product_cat%</strong> : A sanitized version of the product category name (category slug field on New/Edit Category panel). Nested sub-categories appear as nested directories in the URI. <i>This <strong>tag</strong> is specially used for WooCommerce Products.</i>
* <strong>%author%</strong> : A sanitized version of the author name.
* <strong>%author_firstname%</strong> : A sanitized version of the author first name. If author first name is not available so, it uses the author\'s username.
* <strong>%author_lastname%</strong> : A sanitized version of the author last name. If author last name is not available so, it uses the author\'s username.

<strong>Note</strong>: *%postname%* is similar as of the *%title%* tag but the difference is that *%postname%* can only be set once whereas *%title%* can be changed. let's say the title is "This Is A Great Post!" so, it becomes "this-is-a-great-post" in the URI(At the first time, *%postname%* and *%title%* works same) but if you edit and change title let's say "This Is A WordPress Post!" so, *%postname%* in the URI remains same "this-is-a-great-post" whereas *%title%* in the URI becomes "this-is-a-wordpress-post"

=== Tags for Taxonomies ===

* <strong>%name%</strong> : Name of the Term/Category. let's say the name is "External API" so, it becomes external-api in the URI.
* <strong>%term_id%</strong> : The unique ID # of the Term/Category, for example 423
* <strong>%slug%</strong> : A sanitized version of the name of the Term/Category. So "External API" becomes external-api in the URI.
* <strong>%parent_slug%</strong> : A sanitized version of the name of the Term/Category. So "External API" becomes external-api in the URI. This Tag contains Immediate Parent Term/Category Slug if any parent Term/Category is selected before adding it.
* <strong>%all_parents_slug%</strong> : A sanitized version of the name of the Term/Category. So "External API" becomes external-api in the URI. This Tag contains all the Parent Term/Category Slug if any parent Term/Category is selected before adding it.
