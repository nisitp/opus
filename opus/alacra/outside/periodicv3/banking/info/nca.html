		</p><p>
		The National Crime Agency (NCA) tackles serious organized crime that affects the UK and its citizens. This includes Class A drugs, people smuggling and human trafficking, major gun crime, fraud, computer crime and money laundering.
		</p><p>
		<div class="subtitle">Key Facts</div>
		<p>The Economic Crime Command (ECC) is the branch of the NCA that manages the impact of economic crime on the UK. To do this, it has begun; directing the national response to bribery, corruption and sanctions; initiating change in the economic environment through creation of the Joint Money Laundering Intelligence Task Force (JMLIT) and leading the Financial Sector Forum; tackling money laundering through multi-agency cooperation; and ensuring that NCA proactive capabilities are deployed as necessary. 
</p><p>
The ECC's UK Financial Intelligence Unit (UKFIU) has national responsibility for receiving, analyzing and disseminating financial intelligence submitted through the Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) Regime. SARs provide pieces of information which alert law enforcement that certain client/customer activity, for example, the cash purchase of a high-value asset or a series of large out-of-character deposits - is in some way suspicious and might indicate money laundering or terrorist financing.
