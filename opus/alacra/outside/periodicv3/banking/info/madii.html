		<h3>Market Abuse Directive II - MAD II</h3>
		<div class="subinfo">
		<p>
		Market Abuse Regulation (MAR) and Directive on Criminal Sanctions for Market Abuse (CSMAD) were 		passed by European Securities Markets Authority (ESMA) and are known collectively as MAD II. 

		</p><p>
		<div class="subtitle">Key Facts</div>
		<p>MAD II seeks to consolidate the international response to MAD into a more cohesive and effective set of criminal sanctions. To do this it extends the definition of insider trading and market manipulation such that trading on a MTF, OTF, or OTC can be regulated and commodity derivatives are considered to be inside information. Additionally, transaction reporting requirements are clarified and new expectations for simpler information sharing are introduced.</p><p>
Under MAD II, regulators are authorized to receive significant private communications when insider trading is suspected. Furthermore, Attempted Market Manipulation is classified as a unique offense, subject to sanctions and punishment.
