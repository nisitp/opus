	  <h3>Legal Entity Identifier Regulatory Oversight Committee</h3>
		<div class="subinfo">
		<h5>Authorities from around the world</h5>

		The Legal Entity Identifier Regulatory Oversight Committee (LEI ROC) is a group of public authorities from around the globe established in January 2013 to coordinate and oversee a worldwide framework of legal entity identification, the Global LEI System (GLEIS). The Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) is a 20-digit, alpha-numeric code that connects to key reference information that enables clear and unique identification of companies participating in global financial markets.
		</p><p>
		<div class="subtitle">Key Facts</div>
		The ROC, a stand-alone committee established after recommendations by the international Financial Stability Board (FSB) and subsequent endorsement by the Group of 20 (G-20) nations, held its inaugural meeting in January 2013. According to the FSB Report to the G-20, the ROC oversees the Global LEI System so that "there is a unique identifier for each entity that registers, and that there are reliable, while flexible, operational principles and standards applied to the origination and maintenance of an LEI." The ROC has a plenary of members and observers from more than 70 authorities, as well as a regionally balanced Executive Committee that takes forward its work. The ROC is also supported by its standing Committee on Evaluation and Standards, and a Secretariat located in Basel, Switzerland.

		The LEI is a “bar code” for uniquely and precisely identifying legal entities (e.g., businesses, funds, SPVs). It is a 20-digit, alphanumeric code that enables clear and unique identification of companies participating in global financial markets. It is currently required each party to a transaction involving financial derivatives. An overview of the current and proposed regulatory activities including the use of the LEI can be found here:
