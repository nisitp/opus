		The Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970  commonly referred to as the “Bank Secrecy Act” or “BSA” requires U.S. financial institutions to assist U.S. government agencies to detect and prevent money laundering.  The BSA is sometimes referred to as an “anti-money laundering” law (“AML”) or jointly as “BSA/AML.” Several AML acts, including provisions in Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, have been enacted up to the present to amend the BSA.
