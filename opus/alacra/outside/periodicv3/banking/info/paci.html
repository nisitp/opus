		The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board is a nonprofit corporation established by Congress to oversee the audits of public companies in order to protect the interests of investors and further the public interest in the preparation of informative, accurate and independent audit reports. The PCAOB also oversees the audits of broker-dealers, including compliance reports filed pursuant to federal securities laws, to promote investor protection.

		<div class="subtitle">Key Facts</div>
		PACI's overall objective is to facilitate the alignment and acceptance of international anti-corruption norms at the corporate and country level. The strategy is defined by three pillars: 1. Shaping the evolving corporate best practice in implementing effective anti-corruption programs to prevent, detect and address corruption; 2. Enabling collective action through public-private partnerships to address root causes of corruption and develop scalable model process solutions; 3. Helping to define the international anti-corruption architecture through influencing public policy and the effective enforcement of laws and regulations and through alignment and scaling of private-sector engagement in fighting corruption.
