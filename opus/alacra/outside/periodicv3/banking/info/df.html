		The aim of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 is to promote the financial stability of the United States by improving accountability and transparency in the financial system, to end "too big to fail", to protect the American taxpayer by ending bailouts, to protect consumers from abusive financial services practices, and for other purposes.
		</p>
		<p>
		<div class="subtitle">Key Facts</div>
		Creates a new independent watchdog, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, with the authority to ensure American consumers get the clear, accurate information they need to shop for mortgages, credit cards, and other financial products, and protect them from hidden fees, abusive terms, and deceptive practices. Creates a safe way to liquidate failed financial firms and imposes new capital and leverage requirement. Updates the Fed's authority to allow system-wide support but no longer prop up individual firms. Creates a Financial Stability Oversight Council to identify and address systemic risks posed by large, complex companies, products, and activities before they threaten the stability of the economy.  Eliminates loopholes that allow risky and abusive practices to go on unnoticed and unregulated -- including loopholes for over-the-counter derivatives, asset- backed securities, hedge funds, mortgage brokers and payday lenders. Provides shareholders with a say on pay and corporate affairs with a non-binding vote on executive compensation and golden parachutes.  Provides new rules for transparency and accountability for credit rating agencies to protect investors and businesses.
