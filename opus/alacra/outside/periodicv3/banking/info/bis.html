		The mission of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) is to serve central banks in their pursuit of monetary and financial stability, to foster international cooperation in those areas and to act as a bank for central banks. Two key goals of the BIS are: to regulate capital adequacy and make reserve requirements transparent.
		</p><p>
		<div class="subtitle">Key Facts</div>
		In broad outline, the BIS pursues its mission by: promoting discussion and facilitating collaboration among central banks; supporting dialogue with other authorities that are responsible for promoting financial stability; conducting research on policy issues confronting central banks and financial supervisory authorities; acting as a prime counterparty for central banks in their financial transactions; and serving as an agent or trustee in connection with international financial operations.    The head office is in Basel, Switzerland and there are two representative offices: in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China and in Mexico City.
