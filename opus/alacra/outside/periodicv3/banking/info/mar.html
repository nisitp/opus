		<h3>Market Abuse Directive and Regulation (MAD/MAR)</h3>
		<div class="subinfo">
		<h5>
		Regulation 596/2014
		</h5>
		<p>
		MAR aims to strengthen the framework outlined in the 2003 Market Abuse Directive (MAD) by obligating member states to enforce along MAD guidelines. Together these reforms classify insider trading as a criminal offence, punishable with minimum fines of 3x the profit made via abuse or 15% of a company’s turnover.  
		</p><p>
		<div class="subtitle">Key Facts</div>
		Under Article 16(2) of MAR, countries have an obligation to detect and report market abuse.  MAR gives the commission power to adopt regulatory and implementing standards which dictate parameters for what can be considered market abuse and how these incidents of market abuse should be punished.
Implementation is set for July 3rd 2016. 
</p><p>
The Market Abuse Regulation: covers abuse incidents on electronic trading platforms; defines and prohibits abusive behavior on high frequency trading platforms; classifies the manipulation of benchmarks within the domain of Market Abuse; prohibits market abuse in commodity and related derivative markets; and sets the stage for stronger institutional cooperation between financial and commodity regulators.
