		The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), previously known as the Consumer Protection and Markets Authority (CPMA), is the agency of the Government of the United Kingdom, formed as one of the successors to the Financial Services Authority. It regulates financial firms providing services to consumers and maintains the integrity of the UK's financial markets, focussing on the regulation of conduct by both retail and wholesale financial services firms.
		</p><p>
		<div class="subtitle">Key Facts</div>
		The FCA works alongside the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) creating a "twin peaks" regulatory structure in the UK. The FCA is a separate institution and not part of the Bank of England. The FCA is responsible for promoting effective competition, ensuring that relevant markets function well, and for the conduct regulation of all financial services firms. This includes acting to prevent market abuse and ensuring that consumers get a fair deal from financial firms. The FCA operates the prudential regulation of those financial services firms not supervised by the PRA, such as asset managers and independent financial advisers.
