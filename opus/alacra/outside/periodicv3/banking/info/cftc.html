	  <h3>Commodity Futures <br>Trading Commission</h3>
		<div class="subinfo">
		<h5>Independent agency of the US Government.</h5>
		<a href="http://www.cftc.gov/index.htm" style="color: black;:" target="_blank">http://www.cftc.gov/index.htm</a>
		<p>
		The CFTC is an independent agency with the mandate to regulate commodity futures and option markets in the United States. The CFTC's mission is to protect market users and the public from fraud, manipulation, abusive practices and systemic risk related to derivatives that are subject to the Commodity Exchange Act, and to foster open, competitive, and financially sound markets.

		<div class="subtitle">Key Facts</div>
		The Division of Clearing and Intermediary Oversight oversees derivatives clearing organizations, financial integrity of registrants, customer fund protection, stock-index margin, registration and fitness of intermediaries, sales practice reviews, National Futures Association activities related to intermediaries, and foreign market access by intermediaries. The Division of Market Oversight has regulatory responsibility for trade execution facilities, including new registered futures exchanges and derivatives transaction execution facilities. The regulatory functions of the Division include, among other things, market surveillance, trade practice reviews and investigations, rule enforcement reviews, review of product-related and market-related rule amendments, and associated product and market-related studies. The Division of Enforcement investigates and prosecutes alleged violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations. Violations may involve commodity futures or options trading on domestic commodity exchanges, or the improper marketing of commodity investments. The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 expands the CFTC's authority to include regulation of swaps and requires that standardized derivatives be traded through a clearing house.
