		You must give Form W-8ECI to the withholding agent or payer if you are a foreign person and you are the beneficial owner of U.S. source income that is (or is deemed to be) effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States.
		</p>
		<p>
		<div class="subtitle">Key Facts</div>
		Foreign persons are generally subject to U.S. tax at a 30% rate on income they receive from U.S. sources. However, no withholding is required on income that is, or is deemed to be, effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and is includible in the beneficial owner’s gross income for the tax year.
