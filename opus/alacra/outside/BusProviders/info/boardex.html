		BoardEx is the leader in the emerging field of Relationship Capital Management. Relationship capital is the sum of an organization's connectivity to the marketplace, both directly and indirectly. The process by which an organization identifies, evaluates and employs its relationship capital is referred to as Relationship Capital Management. Unlike single user networking websites, BoardEx is a proprietary institutional platform intended for organizations offering high value products and services.
