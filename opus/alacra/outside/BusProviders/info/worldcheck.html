		World-Check creates and maintains a database of Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) and heightened risk individuals and organisations. This database is used by organisations around the world to help to identify and manage financial, regulatory and reputational risks. The creation of the database was in response to legislation aimed at reducing the incidence of financial crime. To begin with, World-Check’s intelligence was used by banks and financial institutions as a comprehensive solution for assessing, managing and remediating risk. However, as legislation has become increasingly complex and its reach has become increasingly global, the demand for such intelligence has grown beyond the financial sector to include organisations from all sectors.
